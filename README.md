# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict and categorize images uploaded by users. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, saved as an H5 file, and deployed in a Go backend for efficient inference.

## Data Structure
### Dataset Organization
- **Training Set**: Contains labeled images organized into class-specific folders
- **Validation Set**: 20% split from the training data for model evaluation during training
- **Test Set**: Separate dataset for final model evaluation
- **Image Format**: RGB images normalized to 224×224 pixels

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Image resizing to uniform dimensions (224×224)
2. Normalization (pixel values scaled to 0-1 range)
3. Data augmentation applied:
   - Random rotations (±20°)
   - Horizontal flips
   - Zoom variation (±20%)
   - Brightness adjustments

## CNN Model Architecture
The custom CNN model follows a standard pattern with increasing filter depth:

```
Input Layer (224×224×3)
↓
Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3 kernel) + ReLU + BatchNorm
↓
MaxPooling (2×2)
↓
Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3 kernel) + ReLU + BatchNorm
↓
MaxPooling (2×2)
↓
Conv2D (128 filters, 3×3 kernel) + ReLU + BatchNorm
↓
MaxPooling (2×2)
↓
Conv2D (256 filters, 3×3 kernel) + ReLU + BatchNorm
↓
MaxPooling (2×2)
↓
Flatten
↓
Dense (512 units) + ReLU + Dropout (0.5)
↓
Dense (# of classes) + Softmax
```

### Training Methodology
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate of 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50 with early stopping (patience=10)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Integration with Go Backend
The model is loaded and used in the Go backend through TensorFlow bindings:

1. Images received from clients are preprocessed using the same pipeline as training
2. The TensorFlow Go API loads the H5 model
3. Prediction results are returned to the client as JSON responses
4. The system implements caching to improve performance for repeated queries

## Scientific Methodologies
### Feature Extraction
- The CNN automatically extracts hierarchical features from raw images
- Lower layers detect edges and textures
- Middle layers identify patterns and shapes
- Higher layers recognize complex object parts

### Regularization Techniques
- Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
- Batch Normalization for stable training
- Early stopping based on validation loss
- L2 regularization on convolutional layers

### Evaluation Protocol
- K-fold cross-validation (k=5) during development
- Confusion matrix analysis
- ROC curves and AUC scores
- Class activation mapping (CAM) for model interpretability

## Future Improvements (Without Limitations)
1. **Architecture Enhancements**:
   - Implement residual connections (ResNet-style)
   - Add attention mechanisms for focusing on relevant image regions
   - Explore EfficientNet scaling principles

2. **Training Optimizations**:
   - Learning rate scheduling with warm-up
   - Mixed-precision training for faster computation
   - Progressive resizing training strategy

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Model quantization to reduce inference time
   - Model pruning to decrease parameter count
   - Knowledge distillation from larger teacher models

4. **Deployment Optimizations**:
   - Convert to TensorRT for faster inference
   - Distributed inference across multiple nodes
   - GPU acceleration in the production environment
